# Daily ML Questions 

After I read the book [Atomic Habit](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), I became a big fan of the book. Here, I attempt to answer daily machine learning question from [bnomial](https://today.bnomial.com): one machine learning question every day. 

In this daily post, you will find:


1. One question per day
2. Review of related concept I do everyday before I attempt a question 
3. Answer and review of answers from the bnomial.
